# Manual Testing

## User Stories Tested:
I have gone through each user story and provided screen shots of all the stories that have been achieved in this project.
Any user story that wasn't completed in this sprint has been moved to the future features ready for the next sprint.

### Epic- User Management:

## Responsiveness

Tested through a range of screen sizes to check for responsiveness. I have included screenshots as proof of responsiveness.

## Browser Compatibility
Tested my website in four different browsers that I have access to.  
I used the dev tools to check the visual for phones, tablets and Desktop.

| Browser | Appearance | Responsiveness |
|---|---|---|
| Opera | Good | Good |
| Edge | Good | Good |
| Chrome | Good | Good |
| Firefox | Good | Good |


## Bugs
All bugs are located in the README.md document

## Lighthouse Report
<img src="static/images/Lighthouse-first-test.JPG" alt="" width="700" height="500">  
I had an issue with first check of lighthouse report with a preformance score (54)

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-final.JPG" alt="" width="700" height="500">  
After changing image sizes by compressing them I have been able to score (95)
However everytime a user uploads a large image to the site the performance goes down.

## Validation:

### HTML code validation: https://validator.w3.org/  
+ All pages had an error with (hr) tag inside the dropdown of the nav.
+ There is an (a) tag nested in buttons the code validation didn't like this but was the only way I could get the python url to link with a button tag.
+ On create post page there is a issue with a (div) tag. This is because of the django format for the form.
+ Post detail page has empty (p) tags. This is because of the comment edit and delete buttons that I have a bug with. Please check the bugs section in the README.md file for more information about the edit and delete function for comments.

### CSS code validation: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator  
<img src="static/images/css-validation.JPG" alt="Image CSS validation code" width="900" height="200">

### Python code validation: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

I used the python test tool pep8 from code institute https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/
I went through every file with .py

After viewing and editing my code only three files haven't passed on everything.
This is because when I indented the code on a new line as it was over 79 characters, it came up with blank line error instead so I decided to stay with longer code as I believe it looks better and easier to read.
The files with > 79 lines:
+ settings.py
+ models.py
+ views.py
+ env.py

## Features

Went through my Heroku deployed site to test all the features.
See table below for all tests.

# Manual Testing

## User Stories Tested:
I have gone through each user story and provided screen shots of all the user stories that have been achieved in this project.
Any user story that wasn't completed in this sprint has been moved to the future feature ready for the next sprint.

## Browser Compatibility
Tested my website in four different browser that I have access to.  
I used the dev tools to check the visual for phones, tablets and Desktop.

| Browser | Appearance | Responsiveness |
|---|---|---|
| Opera | Good | Good |
| Edge | Good | Good |
| Chrome | Good | Good |
| Firefox | Good | Good |


## Bugs
All bugs are location in the README.md document

## Lighthouse Report
<img src="static/images/Lighthouse-first-test.JPG" alt="" width="700" height="500">  
I had an issue with first check of lighthouse report with a preformance score (54)

<img src="static/images/lighthouse-final.JPG" alt="" width="700" height="500">  
After changing image sizes by compressing them I have been able to score (95)

## Validation:

### HTML code validation: https://validator.w3.org/  
+ All pages had an error with (hr) tag inside the dropdown of the nav.
+ There is an (a) tag nested in a button the code validation didn't like this but was the only way I could get the python url to link with a button tag.
+ On create post page there is a issue with a (div) tag. This is because of the django format for the form.
+ Post detail page has empty (p) tags this is because of the comment edit and delete buttons that I have a bug with. Please check the bugs section in the readme.md file for more information about the edit and delete function for comments.

<img src="static/images/css-validation.JPG" alt="Image CSS validation code" width="900" height="200">

### Python code validation: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

I used the python test tool pep8 from code institute https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/
I went the every file with .py

After viewing and editing my code only three files haven't pass on everything.
This is because when I indented the code when it was over 79 characters it came up with blank line error instead so i decided to stay with the none indented code as i believe it looked better and easier to read.
The files with the code is > 79:
+ settings.py
+ models.py
+ views.py
+ env.py

## Features

Went through the site from my heroku deployed site to test all the features.
